# Purpose & design
Taking a basline Linux server install and setting it up to host a web app, secured from a number of attack vectors.

# Getting Started

# Known issues
## Not built
At time of writing, I'm still in planning stages, hence it probably won't work.

# Files

# Contributing
This is an assessed project, so I'd probably get in trouble for accepting external input.

# Code Status
Can Udacity add a badge here..?
