# Purpose & design

5. Navagate through Credentials > Create Credentials > OAuth Client ID > Web application, name your application `UFS-IC' and click create
6. In the UFS-IC credentials click download json and save the file as `client_secrets.json` in the root of your repo clone
## Start the server
7. Navigate to your repo clone in terminal (or your command line)
8. Enter `vagrant up`
9. Enter `vagrant ssh`
## Launch the database
10. Enter `cd /vagrant`
11. Enter `python catalogue.py`
12. Access [localhost port 5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser

# Known issues
## Not pretty
Given that this is a database project, I didn't spend too long on the aesthetics.  It may not be as pretty as the Project Display Example, & doesn't have a latest items display (not mentioned in the rubric) but it does include much cuter images.

# Files
## catalogue_setup.py
SQLAlchemy file that sets up the database.

## catalogue.db
An SQLite database automatically generated by catalogue_setup.py
and populated by the web-app / API.

## catalogue.py
The python flask server that runs the application

## templates & styles
including:
- categories.html
- category.html
- deleteCategory.html
- deleteItem.html
- editCategory.html
- editItem.html
- header.html
- item.html
- login.html
- main.html
- newCategory.html
- newItem.html
most of which are rendered as required by catalogue.py
and static/styles/style.css which styles the above

## Vagrantfile & pg_config.sh
Files required to set up the server & software to run the above
