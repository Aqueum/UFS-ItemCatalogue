# Purpose & design
An application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories. 
Registered users have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

# Getting Started
## Cookies
Either allow 3rd party cookies or allow [*.]facebook.com


# Known issues
## Not built
At time of writing, I'm still in planning stages, hence it probably won't work.

# Files
## catalogue_setup.py
SQLAlchemy file that sets up the database.

## catalogue.db
An SQLite database automatically generated by catalogue_setup.py
and populated by the web-app / API.

# Contributing
This is an assessed project, so I'd probably get in trouble for accepting external input.

# Code Status
Can Udacity add a badge here..?

# License
This is an assessed project, but also may be further developed to help a local community interest company,
as such **all rights are reserved**, feel free to [contact me](http://www.aqueum.com/contact/)
if you have any questions.
